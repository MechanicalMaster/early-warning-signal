Of course. As a senior software engineer, I've reviewed your change request. Here is the implementation plan.

### Implementation Plan

Here is a step-by-step plan to implement the requested UI changes.

#### Step 1: Update Anchor Master Screen

The goal is to simplify the main anchor listing by removing several columns and renaming one for clarity.

*   **File to be modified:** `app/(dashboard)/anchor-master/page.tsx`
*   **Actions:**
    1.  In the `TableHeader`, locate and remove the `<TableHead>` elements for "Anchor ID", "Program Name", and "Program Cust ID".
    2.  Find the `<TableHead>` element with the content "Name" and change its content to "Anchor Name".
    3.  Within the `TableBody`, find the `map` function that iterates over `paginatedAnchors`. Inside the `<TableRow>`, remove the `<TableCell>` elements corresponding to `anchor.id`, `anchor.programName`, and `anchor.programCustId`.

#### Step 2: Update Edit Anchor Screen

This step aligns the anchor editing form with the changes made on the master screen by removing the same fields.

*   **File to be modified:** `app/(dashboard)/anchor-master/[id]/page.tsx`
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Inside the `CardContent` component, locate the `form` element.
    2.  Remove the entire `div` block that contains the `Label` and `Input` for "Anchor ID" (where `htmlFor="id"`).
    3.  Remove the entire `div` block for "Program Name" (where `htmlFor="programName"`).
    4.  Remove the entire `div` block for "Program Cust ID" (where `htmlFor="programCustId"`).
    5.  The label for the "name" field is already "Anchor Name", so no change is necessary.

#### Step 3: Update Dealer Master Screen

This step simplifies the dealer listing screen. I am interpreting the request to rename "Name" to "Dealer Name" for clarity, as renaming it to "Anchor Name" would be redundant with the existing "Anchor" column.

*   **File to be modified:** `app/(dashboard)/dealer-master/page.tsx`
*   **Actions:**
    1.  In the `TableHeader`, remove the `<TableHead>` elements for "Program Name" and "Program Cust ID".
    2.  In the `TableHeader`, find the `<TableHead>` for "Name" and change its text to "Dealer Name".
    3.  Within the `TableBody`'s mapping function, remove the `<TableCell>` elements that render `dealer.programName` and `dealer.programCustId`.

#### Step 4: Update Edit Dealer Screen

This aligns the dealer editing modal with the updated dealer master view.

*   **File to be modified:** `components/edit-dealer-master-dialog.tsx`
*   **Actions:**
    1.  In the component's return statement, find the form within the `DialogContent`.
    2.  Locate the `div` that acts as a grid container for the "Program Name" and "Program Cust ID" inputs.
    3.  Remove this entire grid `div`, which includes the labels and inputs for both fields.

### Configuration / Migrations

*   No configuration or database migration changes are required for this request as it only involves modifications to the front-end presentation layer.
